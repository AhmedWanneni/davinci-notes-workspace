# PROGRESS.md — Current State

Updated at the end of every session. Read this first, before touching code.

## Current Focus

Design system Phase 3 (primitives) is complete. Next session should start composed patterns or wire tokens into apps.

## Done

- **Monorepo Scaffolding**: Configured pnpm workspace, Turborepo pipeline, tsconfig path aliases, and ESLint boundary rules.
- **Local Hooks**: Configured Husky, `lint-staged`, and `commitlint` (Conventional Commits).
- **CI Pipeline**: Configured GitHub Actions workflow running lint, typecheck, test, build, and Storybook build via Turbo affected filter. Verified both passing and failing PR flows.
- **PR Template & Conventions**: Created `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md`.
- **Changesets**: Configured `@changesets/cli` tracking `packages/*` and ignoring apps/services.
- **Design System — Phase 1 (Tokens)**: Style Dictionary pipeline outputs SCSS vars, CSS custom properties, and typed TS constants from token source files (color, type, space, border, motion, icon). Separate `--font-ui` and `--font-editor` tokens.
- **Design System — Phase 2 (Foundation)**: CSS reset, global styles, mixins (border-depth, focus-visible, breakpoints). Stylelint configured with `color-no-hex` rule (ignores `tokens/dist/`).
- **Design System — Phase 3 (Primitives)**: All 12 primitives built and verified (lint, 40 unit tests, Storybook build):

| Primitive | Component + SCSS | Stories (variants/states) | Play fn | Unit tests | TSDoc | Radix |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Typography | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | Slot |
| Button | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | Slot |
| Input | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | — |
| Checkbox | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Radio | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Toggle | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Divider | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | Separator |
| Badge | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | — |
| Tooltip | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Dialog | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| DropdownMenu | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Popover | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

- **Storybook 10 alignment**: Removed deprecated `@storybook/addon-essentials` (merged into core in SB 10); interaction tests use `storybook/test`. `build-storybook` verified passing.
- **Root `.gitignore`**: Monorepo-wide ignore rules for Node/pnpm, build output, Tauri/Rust, mobile artifacts, local vaults/DBs, secrets, Storybook, test coverage, and editor cruft. Decisions: ignore Tauri `gen/` (regenerate locally/CI); commit Style Dictionary `tokens/dist/` (reviewable diffs). See `DECISIONS.md`.

## In Progress

_(nothing)_

## Next Up (in order)

1. Add success/warning semantic color tokens (Badge currently uses placeholder raw hex — see `DECISIONS.md`)
2. Wire `@app/design-system` into `apps/desktop` shell (import tokens + a smoke-test component)
3. Set up Chromatic or Playwright screenshot regression for `components/`
4. Composed patterns: file tree item, sidebar section, command palette row — only after apps can render primitives
5. Migrate SCSS `@import` to `@use` (Dart Sass 3.0 deprecation warnings in build output)

## Blocked / Open Questions

- **Badge success/warning colors**: Placeholder raw hex in `Badge.module.scss` — need confirmed Obsidian semantic palette values or new token entries.
- **Visual regression**: Chromatic account or Playwright screenshot CI not yet configured.

## Session Log

| Date | Focus | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-08-01 | Git Workflow, Hooks, CI & Changesets | Configured Husky, commitlint, lint-staged, GitHub Actions CI workflow, PR templates, CONTRIBUTING.md, and Changesets. All verified. |
| 2026-08-02 | Design system primitives wrap-up | Added Storybook play functions for all primitives, fixed lint error, aligned Storybook 10 deps (removed addon-essentials), verified lint/test/build-storybook. All 12 primitives complete against checklist. |
| 2026-08-02 | Root `.gitignore` | Added monorepo `.gitignore` with section headers. Tauri `gen/` ignored; Style Dictionary `tokens/dist/` committed. Flagged previously tracked `.turbo/` cache for manual untrack review. |
