# PROGRESS.md — Current State

Updated at the end of every session. Read this first, before touching code. Full history: `docs/HISTORY.md`.

## Current Focus

**Theme Ecosystem — Phase 4 In Progress (registry/browser integration)**
The shared registry model now supports a `themes` list locally, and the desktop browser reuses registry fetch, GitHub release resolution, compatibility checks, HTTP downloads, ZIP extraction, and reload lifecycle for themes. Theme-specific archive validation/install and activation are implemented. Updating the external registry repo and real end-to-end network verification are blocked by unavailable network access.

## Last Session

**Theme Ecosystem Phase 2 — Local Loader and Settings**

### Completed
- Added theme discovery and malformed-manifest isolation in [discoverThemes.ts](apps/desktop/src/themes/discoverThemes.ts), using the Phase 1 `@app/theme-api` schema validator.
- Added [ThemeLifecycleManager.ts](apps/desktop/src/themes/ThemeLifecycleManager.ts) with one active theme, persisted active ID, append-before-remove stylesheet replacement, stale-switch generation guards, and cleanup on unload.
- Added the Tauri adapter for `<vault>/.davinci/themes` and SQLite active-theme persistence, then initialized it with the same vault lifecycle used by plugins.
- Added [ThemeSettingsList](apps/desktop/src/components/ThemeSettingsList/ThemeSettingsList.tsx), a separate settings component following the existing `PluginSettingsList` pattern. It lists name/ID/version, selects a theme, restores default styling, and reports skipped folders.
- Phase 1's single-stylesheet light/dark decision is honored. The current app has no independent light/dark setting; its base stylesheet remains dark, so no separate mode-switch integration was possible in this phase.
- Verification: theme manager tests pass for malformed discovery isolation, computed-style A/B switching, return to base styling, and rapid repeated switching with exactly one injected style node. Settings component tests pass for activation and error display. `@app/theme-api` tests (6) and desktop lint pass. Full desktop typecheck remains blocked by the pre-existing `vaultUpdateCounter` and design-system color typing errors.
- No CSS content restriction was added; that remains Phase 3. The ambiguous/inconsistent token aliases documented by Phase 1 were not silently refactored.

**Theme Ecosystem Phase 3 — CSS Safety Review**

### Completed
- Reviewed the actual Phase 2 injection boundary and documented decisions for external `url()`, external `@import`, and CSS-only DOM-state exfiltration in [theme-css-safety.md](docs/theme-css-safety.md).
- Chose documentation plus Phase 4 registry review rather than a load-time sanitizer. This preserves legitimate fonts/images, avoids a parser dependency and foreground switch cost, and avoids a brittle regex filter that could be bypassed.
- Registry review is stricter for external imports: reject them by default because imported CSS can change after approval. Review all external URLs and reject tracking identifiers or state-encoding beacons.
- Added a fixture test proving the Phase 2 loader preserves an external font/image URL and external import unchanged, making the documented behavior executable. No runtime enforcement was added.
- CSS-only exfiltration is considered lower risk than plugin code but non-zero because app metadata exists in DOM attributes; selectors and beacon-like URLs must be reviewed manually.
- Verification: theme API tests (6), theme loader/settings tests (6), desktop lint, and `git diff --check` pass. Full desktop typecheck remains blocked by unrelated existing workspace errors.

**Theme Ecosystem Phase 4 — Registry and Browser Integration**

### Completed
- Extended the local registry seed format with `themes` alongside `plugins`, and extended the submission README with theme release and CSS review requirements.
- Generalized the existing GitHub release-resolution boundary so plugin and theme entries share repository parsing, `versions.json` compatibility resolution, HTTP client, and archive extraction.
- Added theme archive inspection/validation against `@app/theme-api`, `minAppVersion` and release ID/version checks, stylesheet presence checks, safe staged installation under `.davinci/themes`, and uninstall.
- Added the Theme Registry browser section. Installing confirms and auto-activates the theme; updates reuse the same path; uninstall deactivates an active theme first and reloads discovery so default styling returns.
- Existing plugin browser code continues using the same registry client and plugin install path; registry parser and plugin release tests remain passing.
- Verification: theme API tests (6), registry tests (3), theme lifecycle tests (4), settings tests (2), desktop lint, and `git diff --check` pass. Full desktop typecheck remains blocked by unrelated workspace `vaultUpdateCounter` and design-system color typing errors.
- The dedicated GitHub registry could not be cloned or updated in this session because DNS/network access was unavailable. The remote catalog was previously an empty plugin-only catalog; real theme entry, release, install, update, and uninstall verification remain open until that repository is updated with a test theme.

**Plugin Ecosystem Phase 7 — Publishing Template**

### Completed
- Added `registry/plugins.json` and `registry/README.md` documenting the dedicated GitHub registry, author-owned release repositories, PR submission, and lightweight validation requirements.
- Added registry parsing, GitHub release/`versions.json` compatibility resolution, ZIP archive validation, install, update, and uninstall helpers.
- Added `PluginBrowser` to Settings. It has loading/offline states, install consent with Phase 5 permissions, update detection, and unload-before-reload/uninstall lifecycle handling through `PluginLifecycleManager`.
- Added archive checks for safe plugin IDs, manifest ID/version matches, `minAppVersion`, required main entry, and archive path traversal.
- Verification: plugin-api 20 tests pass; plugin-runtime 11 tests pass with lint/typecheck; registry resolver 2 tests pass; desktop lint passes. Full desktop typecheck remains blocked by the pre-existing workspace `vaultUpdateCounter` and design-system color typing errors.
- Real external install/update/uninstall verification remains blocked until a published test plugin and registry repository entry are supplied.
- Populated and pushed `https://github.com/AhmedWanneni/davinci-notes-plugins` at commit `c2ebdca` with `plugins.json`, `registry.schema.json`, submission README, dependency-free validation, and GitHub Actions CI.
- Repointed the browser from the placeholder owner to `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AhmedWanneni/davinci-notes-plugins/main/plugins.json`. The format and fetch mechanism did not need redesign.
- The real registry fetch returns the committed empty catalog successfully. Install and plugin-loader verification remain blocked because the registry has no test entry or author release artifact yet.
- Added the starter plugin with a visible command that writes and reads a vault file, plus TypeScript build and packaging scripts using only a development-time TypeScript dependency.
- Verified the README workflow: fresh `npm install` and `npm run build` produced `dist/manifest.json`, `dist/main.js`, and `dist/versions.json`; the compiled command registered and completed a vault round-trip; a temporary integration test loaded the built package through `PluginLifecycleManager` and invoked its command successfully; the files were copied into the Phase 2 `.davinci/plugins/sample-vault-command/` layout; and a release ZIP was created and inspected.
- No scaffolding CLI was added; the template is the single source of truth. The template surfaced a publishing/API gap: `@app/plugin-api` is not currently distributed as an external SDK, and the loader injects `DavinciPlugin` as a runtime global, so the starter carries a small ambient declaration for the demonstrated surface.

**Plugin Ecosystem Phase 5 — Permission Enforcement**

### Completed
- Added `PluginVault`, `PluginCommands`, and `PluginSettings` contracts and exposed `vault`, `commands`, and `settings` on `DavinciPlugin`.
- Added runtime path validation, command/settings registries, lifecycle cleanup, and desktop adapters.
- Wired plugin commands into the existing lazy command palette and declarative settings tabs into Settings.
- Added fixture coverage for vault round-trip, traversal rejection, restart persistence, per-plugin data isolation, unload/re-enable registry behavior, and watcher write-loop behavior.
- Verification: plugin-api 20 tests pass; plugin-runtime 8 tests pass and lint passes; focused desktop palette/settings tests 5 pass. Full desktop typecheck remains blocked by pre-existing workspace `vaultUpdateCounter` and design-system color typing errors.
- Added `workspace.registerView/openLeaf/closeLeaf/focusLeaf/isViewOpen`, a host-owned plugin leaf, and DOM-only `createEl`/`createText` helpers. Disabled plugins tear down their mounted view.
- Added wrapped editor content, selection, insertion, and content-change APIs. The wrapper never exposes `EditorView` or `EditorState`; CM6 syntax, extensions, transactions, commands, decorations, history, and view plugins remain intentionally unwrapped.
- Added the combined DOM/editor fixture and real CM6 adapter test. Runtime: 9 tests pass; editor adapter: 1 test passes; plugin-api: 20 tests pass. Full desktop typecheck remains blocked by the same pre-existing errors.
- Added centralized permission mapping and call-boundary enforcement: vault read/list, vault write/delete, commands, settings, workspace, and editor read/write operations each map to explicit manifest permissions.
- Added immutable permission snapshots to prevent mid-session manifest mutation from escalating privileges. Added requested-permission visibility to the installed plugin settings list.
- Added adversarial fixtures covering no-permission denial, declared-permission success, escalation attempts, traversal regression, and command cleanup on disable.
- Verification: plugin-runtime 11 tests pass with lint/typecheck; plugin-api 20 tests pass. Focused desktop settings tests pass. Full desktop typecheck remains blocked by pre-existing workspace `vaultUpdateCounter` and design-system color typing errors.
- **`DavinciPlugin` base class**: Added to `packages/plugin-api/DavinciPlugin.ts`, re-exported from `@app/plugin-api` index. Two lifecycle hooks: `onload()` and `onunload()`.
- **`packages/plugin-runtime`** (new package):
  - `pluginTypes.ts`: `PluginRecord`, `PluginStatus`, `PluginFileSystemAdapter`, `PluginStateStorage`, `PluginConstructor`.
  - `evaluatePluginModule.ts`: Safe `new Function(…)` evaluator; extracts `module.exports` / `export default` class extending `DavinciPlugin`.
  - `discoverPlugins.ts`: Scans plugin dirs, validates manifests, detects ID collisions (rejects second, keeps first).
  - `PluginLifecycleManager.ts`: Full enable/disable/unloadAll, `onStateChange` subscription, enabled-IDs persistence, error isolation.
  - `index.ts` barrel + `pluginLifecycle.test.ts` (6 adversarial fixtures: crashing `onload`, malformed manifest, ID collision, mid-session disable, re-enable cycle, restart persistence).
- **Monorepo wiring**: `tsconfig.json` `@app/plugin-runtime` path, `.eslintrc.js` `plugin-runtime` element + boundary rules, `apps/desktop/package.json` + `vite.config.ts` aliases.
- **Desktop Settings UI**: `PluginSettingsList` component + `.module.scss` + barrel + 3 jsdom tests; wired into `SettingsDialog` with `Divider`. `usePluginStore` (Zustand) initialises on vault open in `App.tsx`.
- **Desktop adapter**: `desktopPluginAdapter.ts` implements `PluginFileSystemAdapter` (Tauri plugin-fs `readDir`/`readTextFile`) and `PluginStateStorage` (SQLite `enabledPlugins` setting).

## Blocked / Open Questions

- **Bundle identifier**: Provisional `com.davinci.notes` — confirm before public distribution.
- **Badge success/warning colors**: Placeholder raw hex — need token entries.
- **Visual regression**: Not yet configured.
- **Total JS/CSS size budgets**: lazy chunks counted toward totals — adjust if/when configured.
